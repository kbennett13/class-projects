This project is an implementation of decision trees in MATLAB. The decision tree uses entropy as a measure of information gain to choose the optimal split point.

Tree.m - My Tree class.

trainX.txt - Training data.

trainY.txt - Training labels.

testX.txt - Test data.

testY.txt - The labels given by the decision tree.

DecisionTree.m - Builds the decision tree from the training data and labels the test data, using helper files.
